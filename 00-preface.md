# Preface
>  Watch video for more details and discussions ^ 

Just like mathematicians, software architects also build theories on top of
axioms. But unlike mathematics, the software ecosystem is dynamic and in a
constant change. For example, Kubernetes didn't exist before 2014, but today it
has entire conferences dedicated to it.

There are many books and resources on software architecture that predate the
"current era", where software development didn't look like it does today. The
authors believe that in order to improve our engineering practices, we must
question the fundamental axioms on a regular basis.

From [ï»¿Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/), through CI/CD,
DevOps, microservices, containerization, and now cloud, engineering practices
changed drastically over the years. At one point, "Software Architecture" was
understood as "the stuff that's hard to change later", but with the introduction
of microservices architecture the "change" became a first-class design
consideration.

With this book, the authors want to address _trade-off analysis_. Architects
must assess the good, bad, and ugly of every choice, and since there's no "clear
choice", everything is a trade-off. The authors aim to provide the readers with
an "analytic eye" toward technology choices.
